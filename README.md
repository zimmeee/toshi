# toshi
The initial purpose of this repo is just to use the [Issues](https://github.com/zimmeee/toshi/issues) and [Project Board](https://github.com/zimmeee/toshi/projects/1) to manage tasks related to the birth of Toshi.

# Project Board Recommendations
After a bit of tinkering, I think the Project Board functionality works best when used with Issues (instead of the default functionality which is to create notes).

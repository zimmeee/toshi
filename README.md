# toshi
The initial purpose of this repo is just to use the [Issues](https://github.com/zimmeee/toshi/issues) and [Project Board](https://github.com/zimmeee/toshi/projects/1) to manage tasks related to the birth of Toshi.

# Project Board Recommendations
After a bit of tinkering, I think the Project Board functionality works best when used with Issues (instead of the default functionality which is to create notes). 

**Process**
1. Create new Issue
2. Assign the issue a helpful label (on the right drawer of the Create Issue page)
3. Add the issue to the Project Board (on the right drawer of the Create Issue page)
4. *optional but desirable* - assign the issue to somebody
